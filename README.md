# Project Report: Chest Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to accurately identify and classify different types of chest cancer from medical images. Given the high incidence rate and the various types of chest cancers, timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment.

## Objectives
To build a machine learning model capable of classifying chest cancer images into different categories.
To evaluate the model's accuracy and robustness using a labeled dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images categorized into different types of chest cancer and normal chest images for comparison. The dataset is divided into:
Training set: 613 images
Testing set: 315 images
Validation set: 72 images
Categories
Adenocarcinoma
Large Cell Carcinoma
Normal (non-cancerous)
Squamous Cell Carcinoma

## Data Preprocessing
Image Resizing: All images will be resized to 150x150 pixels.
Normalization: Pixel values will be normalized to the range [0, 1].
Data Augmentation: To increase the diversity of the training set, image augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping will be used.

## Model Architecture
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used, consisting of:
Three convolutional layers, each followed by a ReLU activation and max-pooling.
A fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
A dropout layer for regularization.
A softmax layer for multi-class classification.

## Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## Validation
A separate validation set is used to fine-tune the model parameters and prevent overfitting.

## Testing
The model's performance is evaluated using a test dataset that the model has not seen during the training or validation phases.

## Expected Outcomes
A trained CNN model capable of classifying chest cancer images into different categories.
Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.

## Conclusion
The successful completion of this project yields a machine learning model capable of assisting medical professionals in diagnosing different types of chest cancer, thereby facilitating timely and effective treatment.
